Of course. Let's analyze the configurations. The behavior you're seeing—first duplicates, now complete unreachability—is a classic symptom of a misconfigured link aggregation bond. The switch and the server are not agreeing on how to treat the group of physical links.

After reviewing our conversation and your configurations, I've identified the most likely problem: **a protocol mismatch between your NixOS bond and the Brocade LAG.**

### The Core Problem: `broadcast` vs. `LACP`

1.  **Brocade Switch:** You configured the LAG as `dynamic`. This tells the switch to use **LACP (IEEE 802.3ad)**, which is the correct, standards-based protocol. It actively negotiates with the server to form a bond.

2.  **NixOS Server:** In your `capstan` module, the bond configuration has `Mode = "broadcast"`. **This is not LACP.** This mode is a simple fault-tolerance method that transmits every packet on every interface in the bond. It does not perform any negotiation with the switch.

This mismatch causes the switch to see a server sending the same packet down multiple links without a proper LACP agreement. To prevent a network loop, the switch's Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) or loop protection will likely disable the ports, leading to the `Destination Host Unreachable` error you see now.

### **Solution: Align the NixOS Bond to use LACP**

You must change the bonding mode in your NixOS configuration to `802.3ad` to match the switch's LACP configuration.

#### 1. Modify Your `capstan` Module

In your `capstan` module file, find the `systemd.network.netdevs` section and make the following change to the `bondConfig`.

**File: `/path/to/your/nixos/modules/capstan.nix`**

```nix
# ... inside the config = mkIf cfg.enable { ... }; block

    # MODIFIED: systemd-networkd configuration with shared logic
    systemd.network = {
      enable = true;

      # Bond netdev is created if any bonding mode is active
      netdevs = mkIf (cfg.bonding.mode != "none") {
        "20-bond0" = {
          netdevConfig = {
            Name = "bond0";
            Kind = "bond";
          };
          # --- CORRECTED bondConfig SECTION ---
          bondConfig = {
            # Change this from "broadcast" to "802.3ad"
            Mode = "802.3ad";
            
            # These are highly recommended for LACP performance and compatibility
            LACPTransmitRate = "fast";
            TransmitHashPolicy = "layer3+4";
            MIIMonitorSec = "100ms";
          };
        };
      };
# ... rest of the file
```

#### 2. Rebuild and Reboot

Apply the new configuration and reboot the server to ensure the network stack is fully re-initialized.

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
sudo reboot
```

### **Troubleshooting & Verification Steps**

After the server reboots, follow these steps to verify that the bond is working correctly.

#### 1. Verify on the Brocade Switch

SSH into your switch and check the LAG status.

```bash
show lag server01
```

You are looking for the member ports (`1/3/3`, `1/3/4`) to have a state of `Up` and, most importantly, for the `[Ope]` (Operational) column to show them as part of the LAG. If LACP negotiation is successful, the links will be active.

#### 2. Verify on the NixOS Server

SSH into your server (`beefcake`) and check the status of the bond interface.

```bash
cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0
```

Look for these key lines:
* **`Bonding Mode: IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation`** (Confirms the mode is correct)
* **`LACP Activity: active`**
* Under each "Slave Interface", you want to see **`MII Status: up`**.
* You should see both of your member NICs listed as slave interfaces.

#### 3. Test Connectivity

Now, try the ping again from your other machine (`172.16.4.51`).

```bash
ping 172.16.4.53
```

You should now get successful replies without duplicates or errors.

### If The Problem Persists: Check VLANs

If the bond comes up but you still can't pass traffic, the next most likely issue is a VLAN mismatch. You need to ensure the **LAG interface itself** on the switch is configured for the correct VLAN.

For example, if your servers are in VLAN 10, you would run these commands on the Brocade switch:
```bash
# On the switch
configure terminal

# Enter the VLAN configuration
vlan 10

  # Make the LAG interface an untagged member of this VLAN
  untagged ethernet lag 1

exit
write memory
```


# On the switch
enable
configure terminal

# Enable jumbo frames globally
jumbo

# You will see a message like:
# "Jumbo mode setting requires a reload to take effect!"

# Save the configuration
write memory

# Reload the switch to apply the jumbo setting
reload

# Confirm with 'y'
